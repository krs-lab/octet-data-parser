# octet-data-parser
## Summary
This notebook digests exported Octet data into discrete CSV files for individual events.

We often wish to process biolayer interferometry data (BLI) generated by [Octet instruments](https://www.sartorius.com/en/products/biolayer-interferometry) offline, in graphing programs like [Prism](https://www.graphpad.com/features). 

Raw datasets with multiple binding/dissociation events are exported as a single trace with a continuous time counter.

To simplify the process of extracting individual events, this notebook allows the user to 1) upload a raw dataset, 2) define timestamps that mark the beginning and end of association and dissociation phases, and 3) export these as separate .CSV files that begin at time = 0.

You can try running this is your own Anaconda environment, or on Google CoLab here:

## Notes

* This notebook assumes that you want to export one set of contiguous association and dissociation events. If you have multiple sets of events in a single run, you will have to run through the whole process for each set of events. For more complex analyses, with more event types, you may want to edit the code accordingly.
* The blue/white trace shows the selected events in the context of the full trace. Ensure that you successfully captured the events as intended.
* The timestamps exported by the instrument may not be perfect. It may be necessary to adjust the boundary between phases by a fraction of a second to - for example - capture the earliest component in a dissociation phase.
